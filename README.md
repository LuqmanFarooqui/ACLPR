# ACLPR

### Instructions:
- Place the files in the following folder: `ultimateALPR-SDK\samples\python\recognizer` and run as per the platform specific instructions in the original repo link below.
- Change the input/output locations set in the files as required.
- The `img_recognizer.py` file takes only one image as input. This script can be used for testing and debugging purposes and will save the processed image.
- The `vid_recognizer.py` file takes a video as input. This will save a video with the processed video.
